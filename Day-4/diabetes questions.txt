read diabetes.csv and pick column names from column headings file. column name should be clean without anything in ()
remove special chars from column name
#1. Count the number of missing values (NaN) in each column
#1.1 remove all rows where special chars are there
#1.2 remove special chars from column names if any
#1.2.1 find the outliers in the dataframe. you can use 3 SD technique or IQR method or box plot 
#1.3 replace outliers with mean value of that column (you can use 3 Standard deviation technique, IQR method) to find outlier 
#2. count all zeros in every column, Replace all the 0 values with NaN in a df and count them again
#3. Create a copy of original dataframe and remove all the rows where missing values are there and count number of rows before and after droping it
#4. in the original data frame Impute/put the mean value in place of missing values of that column and cross check if all missing values have been imputed or not
#5 create a heat map showing correlation between variables
#6 find the variance in each column
#7 find the missing value ratio for every column (missing value ratio means missing value divided by total number of values in a column)
#8 create logistic regression model (dependent var is Class variable (0 or 1)) - IGNORE
#9 create decision tree model (dependent var is Class variable (0 or 1)) - IGNORE
